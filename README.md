This is a repository where I am storing my Python files for others, including potential employers, to view and use as
they wish. These files have been developed using Vim from bash/terminal, and although I have to say Vim is my favorite way to fly, I am capable of developing on Windows, OS/X, or Linux. 

I am seeking to transition into software development after several years in Information Technology support, and 
then as a Telecommunications Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition, troubleshooting problems, and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. Top notch English skills, both written and verbal. I know, that last one wasn't a complete sentence, but it sounded really good, eh? 

I'm hoping to land a job within the next year as an entry-level tester or developer. My self-study has leaned toward data using numpy, pandas, and seaborn via the Anaconda distribution, but I'm up for just about anything.

If you would like to get in touch with me, email me at: me33tz@gmail.com. 

Cheers,
Josh Metz
