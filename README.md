These files have been developed using Vim from bash/terminal, and although I have to say Vim is my favorite way to fly, I am capable of developing on Windows, OS/X, or Linux. 

I am seeking to transition into software development after several years in Information Technology support, and 
then as a Telecommunications Technician. I have an extensive technical background, with a special talent for 
pattern recognition, troubleshooting problems, and an ability to digest new technologies rapidly. 

I'm hoping to land a job within the next year as an entry-level tester or developer. My self-study has leaned toward data using numpy, pandas, and seaborn via the Anaconda distribution of Python, but I'm also learning Xcode/Swift. 

Cheers,
Josh Metz
